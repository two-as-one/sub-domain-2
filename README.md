# Sub domain 2

An evolution of sub domain 1 (which was never finished)

## Concepts

- An adult-themed game
- card-based 'combat'
- 'combat' is a mixture between conflict and foreplay
- rogue lite gameplay with mostly run-based progression but also some permanent progression (such as upgrading your start base)

## Goals

- The game needs to cater to both the sub and dom play style
- Doms should never be forced into submissive roles (would rather die than submit)
- Encounters should be relatively quick, with a few high-impact decisions to make
- a game session should be around 1 hour
  - rogue lite with an aspect of permanent progression (like darkest dungeon / rogue legacy)
- 'purist' runs should be possible
- the game should feature friendly npc's
- encounters should be balanced such that the player can complete multiple ones
- player should have agency over all of their actions, with randomness sprinkled in to introduce an aspect of decision making

## Theme & setting

Set in a scifi universe, the player is on a sandy planet has a ship that serves as their home base. The player will encounter NPC's that can come live in their ship. The player has a highly customizable body whose body parts can be changed, but their mind can also be upgraded with skill chips.

Why is the player on this planet? Are they stranded? Why do they go on expeditions.

- scifi and technology with high biodiversity
- has eldritch monsters and mild body horror
- magic is mostly biological, potions and transformations exists but fireball doesn't
