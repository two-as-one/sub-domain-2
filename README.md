# Sub domain 2

An evolution of sub domain 1 (which was never finished)

## Concepts

- An adult-themed game
- card-based 'combat'
- 'combat' is a mixture between fighting and foreplay
- rogue lite gameplay with mostly run-based progression but also some permanent progression (such as upgrading your start base)

## Goals

- The game needs to cater to both the sub and dom play style
- Doms should never be forced into submissive roles (would rather die than submit)
- Encounters should be relatively quick, with a few high-impact decisions to make
- a game session should be around 1 hour
  - rogue lite with an aspect of permanent progression (like darkest dungeon / rogue legacy)
- 'purist' runs should be possible
- the game should feature friendly npc's
- encounters should be balanced such that the player can complete multiple ones
- player should have agency over all of their actions, with randomness sprinkled in to introduce an aspect of decision making

## Theme & setting

Set in a scifi universe, the player is stranded on a sandy planet and must go on expeditions to refuel their ship. The player will encounter NPC's that can come live in their ship. The player has a highly customizable body whose body parts can be changed, but their mind can also be upgraded with skill chips

- scifi and technology with high biodiversity
- has eldritch monsters and mild body horror
- magic is mostly biological, potions and transformations exists but fireball doesn't

## Game flow

1. prepare at camp
2. go on expedition
   1. choose destination
   2. choose one of x paths
      - 3-4 options each with clear risks and benefits
      - example:
        - path 1 is probably safe, high chance of nothing happening at all
        - you can hear some faint sounds on path 2, most likely an encounter
        - path 3 probably has an item
   3. encounter
   4. repeat 1. and 3. x times
   5. boss?
3. spoils!
4. return to camp
