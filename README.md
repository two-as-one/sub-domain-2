# Sub domain 2

An evolution of sub domain 1 (which was never finished)

## Concepts

- An adult-themed mostly text-based adventure game
- Encounters are a 'tug of war' to determine who is the sub and who is the dom
- The game features transformations
  - transformations unlock new abilities or provide stat boosts
- the game features encounters but no combat, everything is resolved by the power of love

## Goals

- The game needs to cater to both the sub and dom play style
- Doms should never be forced into submissive roles (would rather die than submit)
- Encounters should be relatively quick, with a few high-impact decisions to make
- a game session should be around 1 hour
  - rogue lite with an aspect of permanent progression (like darkest dungeon / rogue legacy)
- 'purist' runs should be possible
- the game should feature friendly npc's
- encounters should be balanced such that the player can complete multiple ones
- player should have agency over all of their actions, with randomness sprinkled in to introduce an aspect of decision making

## setting

- a world of low magic but with high biodiversity
- has eldritch monsters and mild body horror
- has more traditional monsters
- magic is mostly biological, potions and transformations exists but fireball doesn't

## mechanics

- stats
  - dominance
  - submission
  - resolve
- HP is called 'resolve' and is a measure of both physical and mental, when it drops to 0, the player has to abandon their expedition and return to camp.
- Winning an encounter (can) restore resolve

- player's stats determined by cards in their deck?
- cards can balance strong effects vs good stats
- each deck is always 10 cards

## progression

- player can use consumable items to progress along a tree
- certain branches of the tree are mutually exclusive (what if the player changes their mind?)
- progressing along the tree can unlock new cards or change existing ones

## Game flow

1. prepare at camp
2. go on expedition
   1. choose destination
   2. choose one of x paths
      - 3-4 options each with clear risks and benefits
      - example:
        - path 1 is probably safe, high chance of nothing happening at all
        - you can hear some faint sounds on path 2, most likely an encounter
        - path 3 probably has an item
   3. encounter
   4. repeat 1. and 3. x times
   5. boss?
3. spoils!
4. return to camp

### possible

## example combat

### turn order

1. upkeep
2. draw 5 cards
3. determine enemy intention
4. play card 1
5. play card 2
6. resolve enemy intention
7. discard hand

### cards

default deck:
... ?

male:
2 penis
1 anal

female:
1 vagina
1 anal
1 boobies

### key words

climax: triggers if the opponent was reduced to 0 resolve during this turn
soothe: restores an amount of resolve
fatigue: reduces the opponent's resolve by an amount
endure: gain temporary resolve until the end of the turn
satisfy: reflects an amount of fatigue back to the opponent until the end of the turn
boost: improves one of your stats until the end of the encounter

### enemies

combat is usually vs 1 enemy, but could have more. most cards only affect the front enemy, though certain cards could affect multiples or target specific bak rows. The back enemy can't attack the player unless they have specific attacks to do so.

### example enemy actions

- penetrate (requires dom 5+)
  - fatigue equal to dom
- exert dominance
  - dom +2
- jerk off
  - ???
