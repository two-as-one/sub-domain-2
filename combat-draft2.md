- The player has two stances they can be in combat / foreplay
- cards can have different top / bottom actions depending on the stance the player is in
- example:

  - kick
    top: deal x damage
    bottom: enter combat stance

  - cock
    top: deal x damage
    bottom: deal x \* 2 damage

- enemies will have different intentions based on the player stance
- enemies may want to switch to specific stance based on their HP

## undecided

- different rewards based on final stance?
